          <h3>Get To Know Me</h3>
          <p> Hey! My name is Alex Baranowski and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science at Rutgers Unversity in New Brunswick, New Jersey. I am expected to graduate in May 2020 and looking forward to working the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            My strengths are primarily in Java, C++, and C coding, though I have built a few personal projects using Python and Javascript. I learned Java, C++, and C through my university's curiculum whereas Python and Javascript I self-taught myself. I have created several websites on my freetime as well, including this one, using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP, and mySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be sure to take a look at some of the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I have showcased.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Besides coding, I pride myself in being a creative thinker and am always working on things that will help me be more productive, artistic, and educated. Many of my projects are fueled by my curiousity that constantly needs to be satisfied. My leadership skills as well as being able to communicate my ideas to others has always been my strong suit.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            If you are are at all interested in contacting me with any further questions or concerns, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
